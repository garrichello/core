This is a computing backend for a web-GIS CLIMATE (http://climate.climate.scert.ru/).
It is intended to read geospatial meteorological and climatological data from server-stored data archives, 
data processing using various analytical/statistical/mathematical processing modules (implemented as Python-classes),
and preparing georeferenced graphical (geoTIFF) and binary (netCDF) output for the following 'ingestion' 
by the Geoserver software for displaying to the user.
This backend is intended to work only in the framework of the web-GIS CLIMATE. However can be tuned to work stand-alone.
