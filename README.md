This is a computing backend for a web-GIS CLIMATE (http://climate.climate.scert.ru/).
It is intended to read geospatial meteorological and climatological data from server-stored data archives, 
to process data using various analytical/statistical/mathematical processing modules (implemented as Python classes),
and to prepare georeferenced graphical (geoTIFF) and binary (netCDF) output for the following 'ingestion' 
by the Geoserver software for displaying to a user.
This backend is intended to work only in the framework of the web-GIS CLIMATE. However can be tuned to work stand-alone.
